    The other {organism} worried about their friends in the {thing}.\n \
    Seeing how deep the {thing} was, they told the two {organism} that\n \
    there was no way they could escape the deep {thing} and that\n \
    there was no point in trying.They continued to constantly\n \
    discourage them as the two {organism} tried to jump out of the\n \
    {thing}. But keep falling back.Soon, one of the two {organism} started\n \
    to believe the other {organism}, that they all never be able to escape\n \
    the {thing} and eventually died after giving up.The other {organism} keeps\n \
    trying and eventually jumps so high that he escapes the {thing}. The\n \
    other {organism} were shocked at this and wondered how he did it.The\n \
    difference was that the second {organism} was deaf and couldnâ€™t hear\n \
    the discouragement of the group. He simply thought they were\n \
    cheering him on!"
